### Fraud Detection Model and Deployment
![model_deployment](model_deployment.png)

For this project, I developed and deployed a fraud detection system using multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and XGBoost.

Key Steps:
- Data Preparation: Processed a credit card transaction dataset to identify fraudulent activities.
- Model Training: Trained multiple classifiers to detect fraud, optimizing them for accuracy and efficiency.
- Model Evaluation: Compared model performances to determine the best approach.
- Deployment: Built APIs using FastAPI and Flask to serve real-time fraud detection predictions.
- Testing: Used Postman to validate the API responses.

## TABLEAU Projects
### Retail Sales Data Analysis: A First Glance
![Retail Sales Data Analysis](Retail Sales Data Analysis.png)

As part of the HNG data analytics internship, we were tasked with exploring a dataset and writing a technical report based on our findings. I chose the Retail Sales Dataset available on Kaggle, and the goal was to examine the data, identify initial trends, and communicate these findings effectively. This report presents my observations and initial analysis using a Tableau dashboard created to visualize the key aspects of the data.

Within this section of my portfolio, I present a detailed analysis of accident data, covering various dimensions such as accident severity, date, month, and year of occurrence, geographical location (latitude and longitude), light conditions, district area, number of casualties and vehicles involved, road surface conditions, road type, urban or rural area classification, weather conditions, and vehicle type. By examining these variables, I offer valuable insights into the patterns and factors contributing to accidents, facilitating a deeper understanding of road safety dynamics. This analysis aims to inform policy-making, urban planning, and public safety initiatives by identifying trends, risk factors, and potential interventions to mitigate the impact of accidents on communities and individuals.
